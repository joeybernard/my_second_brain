## Highlights
- If I have a thought, I write it down on a 4×6 notecard and identify it with a theme–or if I am working on a specific project, where it would fit in the project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8h4ckre1d1rznbp4pjwfw8))
- Most of the time, what I write down are quotes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8h7827h45cqa7kcbe75504))
- It’s very important that you mark quotes properly so you never risk forgetting to attribute. To make this extra clear, I always put a circle around the first quotation mark. If I am quoting someone quoting someone else, I’ll usually write “qtd in.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8h7m3cjhzxtg4e74shp4e6))
- If it’s a really long story or example, I will just jot down a few notes on the key points and then put something like: “For a story about _________ see: pg 14 in [insert book].” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8h7re0ybkn90e134mbvx0n))
- Read a book or an article and diligently mark the passages and portions that stand out at you. If you have a thought, write it down on the page (this is called marginalia). Fold the bottom corner of the page where you’ve made a note or marked something (alternatively, use post-it flags). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8haaw7n608v0qy9x8rwmax))
- A few weeks after [finishing the book](https://www.writingroutines.com/how-to-write-book/), return to it and transfer those notes/thoughts on to the appropriate note cards. Why wait? Waiting helps you separate the wheat from the chaff. I promise that many of the pages you marked will not seem to important or noteworthy when you return to them. This is a good thing–it’s a form of editing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8hazk3jvdw46vg3e7s48wb))
- In the top right hand corner of each card, put a theme or category that this card belongs to. If a card can fit in multiple categories, just make a duplicate card. Robert uses color coded cards for an extra layer of organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jh8hbcxn1nrxa16j857g5v88))
