This site is the central hub for research using health data. The key parts are the technology, the data gateway and the analysis parts.

## Technology

They describe their entire ecosystem and technology stack. They have useful sections describing the standards GA4GH, OMOP and FIHR. They also have discussions around people support.

## Data Gateway
source: https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/research/research-data-infrastructure/the-gateway/
The Gateway is an enterprise-level solution designed to support collaboration and open-development at scale. It is built on Google Cloud and uses cutting-edge, open-source frameworks (such as Next.js and Laravel), along with OpenAPI standards to ensure the scalability, maintainability and interoperability of the platform, now and in the future.  Industry-standard tools such as Elasticsearch power the Gateway’s trainable search functionality, and BC Platforms supports delivery of Cohort Discovery.

HDR UK introduced a major new version of the Gateway in late 2024 with significant enhancements designed to empower the research community and accelerate scientific discovery for public benefit. Find out more about this update, here.

## Federated Analysis

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure locations in which data are safely available for researchers to analyse, however it is difficult for researchers to perform analyses across multiple TREs. Variability amongst TRE implementations and the analysis tools that use them prevent this federated approach to data access and analysis. Federated analytics at scale requires a solution that’s straightforward for existing, independent systems to adopt, that can cope with the variety of system implementations, and works within the Five Safes framework that enables data services to provide safe research access to data.

### Pilots projects
During the TRE-FX and TELEPORT pilot projects supported by DARE UK, proof of concept solutions to support federated analytics were developed. This work demonstrated how to streamline the use of analysis tools across multiple TREs while ensuring that the access is safe.

The Federated Analytics Programme will build on this work to ensure that all HDR UK Research Driver Programmes, and the wider scientific community, have access to advanced federated analytics services.

## Trusted Research Environments

Aligning approach to Trusted Research Environments is a workstream convened by the UK Health Data Research Alliance.
It brings together a community of members and researchers to develop and define standard approaches to Trusted Research Environments (TREs), also known as ‘Data Safe Havens’ or ‘Secure Data Environments’.

The aim of the Alliance workstream is that Alliance TREs will meet researchers technical and functional requirements whilst providing confidence to data custodians and the public. This will be done through a data access system that has evolved from the Five Safes model.
