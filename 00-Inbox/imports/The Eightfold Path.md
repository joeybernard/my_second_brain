- **Right View** - through understanding that everyone suffers, and that life is impermanent, we begin to attain the wisdom to see the nature of all things. We see things as they really are.
- **Right Intention** - there is energy in our thoughts, and we must ensure that this energy is directed in a positive way. Our thoughts lead to our behavior, and so with a compassionate mind towards all things, we refuse to engage in behavior that cruel.
- **Right Speech** - words have power, words have weight. The importance of speech in our species is unquestionable. Buddha stated that we should not lie or attempt deceit, that we should not gossip or slander, that we should not hurt others with our words and that we should refrain from idle speech - speak less, think more.
- **Right Action** - this is also explained in the 5 Noble Precepts. We should refuse to kill or act violently, we should not steal or be dishonest but live in a just way, we should abstain from sexual misconduct that harms others, we must talk sincerely and with honesty, and we should seek the Middle Way.
- **Right Livelihood** - in essence, this would be having an occupation that is in harmony with the 5 Noble Precepts. It means having an occupation that is not harmful, such as the weapons trade. It suggests choosing a living that is just and compassionate.
- **Right Effort** - this means learning and living with a self-discipline that engenders compassion to all things. It is a conscious effort to live positively by preventing unwholesome states and to nurture and maintain wholesome states that have already arisen.
- **Right Mindfulness** - this is the controlled mental and physical faculty of being mindful all the time. We will look at mindfulness later, but in brief, it is being aware of things and seeing them for what they really are - your reactions to an event, your feelings, your environment. It is the recognition of all the other extraneous thought processes that occur after the initial impression of an event, such as judgement, anger, insolence and so on. The goal is to reach beyond these extraneous thoughts to a life of living in the pure moment with a pure mind.
- **Right concentration** - often described as one-pointedness of mind, this is the development of the power of concentration by complete immersion in the present moment. It is achieved in Zen through meditation, where step by step we learn to deal with distractions and desires and achieve a fulfilled life thanks to our efforts in concentration.
