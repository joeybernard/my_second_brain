## I. Introduction

The Vegvisir, also known as the Icelandic compass, is a powerful symbol with deep roots in Icelandic culture and Norse mythology. This symbol has been around for centuries and is believed to have been used by Vikings as a form of guidance and protection. The symbol is a circle with eight arms and a central point, and is said to represent the eight cardinal directions, with the central point representing the center of the universe. In this blog post, we will delve into the history and meaning of the Vegvisir, its design and construction, its role in Icelandic culture, and how it is still used today for guidance and protection.

## II. The History and Origins of the Vegvisir

The origins of the Vegvisir can be traced back to the Viking age, where it is believed to have been used by Norse seafarers as a form of guidance. The symbol is thought to have been passed down through generations by the Vikings and was eventually recorded in the Huld Manuscript, an Icelandic grimoire dating back to the late 1700s. The Huld Manuscript is a collection of Icelandic magic staves and symbols, and the Vegvisir is one of the most well-known symbols recorded in it.

The exact origins of the Vegvisir are not known, but it is speculated that it may have been created by Icelandic shamans or priests as a way to navigate the treacherous and unpredictable seas of the North Atlantic. Some experts believe that the symbol may have been inspired by the Viking age runestones, which often featured intricate designs and symbols with spiritual significance.

Throughout history, the Vegvisir has evolved and changed over time. The earliest known examples of the symbol are found on Viking age runestones, and it is believed that the symbol was also used in traditional Icelandic magic practices. As time passed, the symbol has been adapted and incorporated into other cultural traditions and spiritual practices, becoming an important symbol in Icelandic culture.

The "[Saga of Hrana hrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrana_saga_hrings "Hrana_saga_hrings")" (Circle of the Saga of Hrana), which is one of the [Icelandic Sagas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagas_of_Icelanders "Sagas_of_Icelanders"), which only exists in manuscripts dating from 1887-1888, mentions the Vegvisir:"... the weather was cloudy and stormy.... ".the king looked around him and did not see the blue of the sky... then the king took the Vegvisir in his hands and saw where\[the sun\] appeared on the stone...".

The symbol appears in an Icelandic book of magic, or grimoire, known as [Galdrabók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galdrab%C3%B3k "galdrabok"), published around 1600 AD. Also, in 1860, in the'Huld Manuscript', Geir Vigfusson mentions the Vegvisir.

Vigfusson has collected and categorized various Icelandic folk symbols using much older material. A page of the manuscript provides an image of the vegvísir, gives its name, and, declares that "if this sign is worn, you will never lose your way in storms or bad weather, even if the path is not known...".
