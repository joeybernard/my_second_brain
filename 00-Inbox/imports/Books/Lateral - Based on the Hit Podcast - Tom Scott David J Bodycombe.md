description: "The first book based on Tom Scott's hit podcast, LATERAL! Unlock a world of mind-bending brainteasers. This massive collection of lateral thinking puzzles features 100 questions with unexpected, fascinating answers. Figuring them out will require you to challenge your assumptions and find new perspectives—but whether you find the solutions or not (even Tom has been stumped!), the answer notes will let you share the “aha!” while learning more about the puzzle’s subject. Use hints to solve solo or play as a party game; each question is sure to spur hilarious brainstorming and enthusiastic discussion. What You’ll Find Inside: 120 Puzzles: Including 40 of the most captivating questions from the LATERAL podcast, 60 brand-new puzzles, and 20 warm-up brainteasers to get you in the zone. Real-World Scenarios: Unlike typical lateral thinking puzzles based on farfetched set-ups and absurd situations, LATERAL features questions based on actual events. For instance, can you figure out why, in 1998, some moviegoers left theaters showing Meet Joe Black before the movie even started? The answer: They only came to see the trailer for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace! Reportedly, some cinemas promised to play the trailer a second time at the end of the movie to encourage Star Wars fans to stick around. Hints and Surprising Solutions: Each puzzle comes with helpful hints and detailed explanations. Even if you're stumped, you’ll be entertained by the solutions, which are accompanied by bonus commentary and trivia. Play Solo or with Friends: Use these puzzles for solo solving sessions or turn them into fun group games for parties, family nights, or road trips. Each puzzle is designed to ignite conversations and inspire laughter. Whether you’re a fan of logic puzzles, brain buster games, or you’re simply looking for a unique adult puzzle book, LATERAL will challenge your assumptions, stretch your mind, and keep you entertained for hours. Plus, with supplementary details on every puzzle, this book doubles as an intriguing dive into the curious side of the world we live in."
