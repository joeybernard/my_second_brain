description: "A no-nonsense guide to the mind-body training necessary for budo, the study of traditional Japanese martial arts for self-cultivation—from a sixth-degree black belt and iaido teacher Budo is about learning more than how to fight; true budo is a way of seeking and uncovering meaning in life. Here, Nicklaus Suino, one of the leading iaido teachers in North America, gives expert advice on how to get the most from training in traditional Japanese martial arts such as iaido, kendo, aikido, judo, kyudo, and karate-do. He reveals the essential components of budo training, including how to: • determine the principles behind techniques • develop physical strength, technical strength and strength of character • discipline your mind to really focus and be in the present moment"
