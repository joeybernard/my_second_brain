My name is Joey Bernard. I started out with a Physics undergraduate degree, and then moved on to get a Computer Science degree. After 25+ years working in the industry, I decided to go back to get my PhD in Physics. I am doing this part-time, while I still work as a Digital Research Consultant for ACENET.
