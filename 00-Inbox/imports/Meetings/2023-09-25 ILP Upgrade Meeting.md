# Meeting Title
- **Date:** 2023-09-25
- **Start Time:** 15:00
- **End Time:**
- **Attendees:** 

## Meeting Objective
To discuss the remaining items left over from the ILP upgrade that happened before I started.

## Agenda
- Single Sign On
- EDU primary affiliation will be used to autoprovision the appropriate accesses in D2L

## Notes and Decisions
- ILP changes happened at the end of April
- CEL currently needs to manually run bulk jobs - they run in the morning. 
- SAML needs to be done by December 31. SSO is on our own timeline.
- We could use the focus accounts on test to test this out with. We could delete them and retry provisioning.

## Action Items
1. Need to verify that when a new user comes over, ILP should pick them and manage enrollments properly
2. We need to come up with a set of test cases
