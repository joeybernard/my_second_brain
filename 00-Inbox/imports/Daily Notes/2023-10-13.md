### Notes
- Still on vacation, but trying to get caught up before the next week starts.
- Emailed Dan about Physics department eclipse activity. They are fully focused on working with the Department of Education. It will not really leave much free time available to work with the regional efforts.
- Emily confirmed that the ILP/Colleague SQL testing is done and good to go. She let Heather Ongo know.
