# Day planner


# New Tasks


# Log
- Did a load of reading and project planning
- 10:00 - CRC Call
- 11:00 - R consultation
	- It looks like I will need to do the analysis runs in order to see where time is really being chewed up
	- Their opinion is that the filter and merge of output files in the step 3.4 is the major pain point
