## Log
- Meeting with Mahmoud Azimaee from ICES #ACENET #NB-IRDT 
	- pandemic forced them to go fully remote access, already had infrastructure set up 
	- bandwidth limited the capacity before the pandemic
	- even in the office, you connect "remotely"
	- data centre is on-prem
	- independent of the university as its own non-profit
	- a branch of ICES was opened to third-party data access
	- they have a tenancy with HPC4Health, just for compute resources
		- only some data is available to be run on HPC4Health
		- allowed data sets are synchronized to the tenancy
		- for other projects, they have a folder that links to HPC4Health
		- there are role based access based on title
		- then you have project based access that sits on top of this
	- aiming to migrate to commercial cloud for both
	- no real challenges other than having enough server hardware
	- they have disaster recovery on Azure
	- ICES gets raw data, so they have to de-identify the data sets
	- some rare data sets that are required to be on-prem
