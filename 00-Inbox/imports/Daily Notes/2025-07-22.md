# Log
- collected links to Canadian SWC folks
- Had a meeting with the Apporto folks. They think they might be able to setup a front-end that will allow access to the RDP service on the Horizons server.
- Researched levels of data security.
- Met with Tausif. He mentioned issues around Win10 reaching end of life. I added items to the data trust project.
- Ted asked for someone to help out with statcan upgrades while Tausif is out of the country. I offered to help out when I am in the country.
