## Log
- Worked on #MOTUS stuff this evening. They have serious DB issues. I used a Perl script call mysqltuner to do a basic check. They have no performance tables setup, so the only data is basic. There are loads of errors/warnings in the log files. Also, there are loads of slow queries. The worst are the deletes from tagDeps and then inserts into tagDeps. Not sure why they are doing it this way. Why don't they use "INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE"?
