## Log
- Meeting with Sam Stewart about SRE and REDCap #NB-IRDT #ACENET 
	- SRE
		- Uses a cloud system - rolled out fall 2017
		- SRE is a locked down remote desktop
		- Uses Dal VPN, uses Dal authentication, uses dummy accounts for external users
		- Servers in the Killam server farm, Cloudera, probably paying too much, use hadoop to hold the data
		- Front-end is Windows 
		- SAS is mostly used, R partially supported
		- Very RAM heavy, very costly to upgrade
		- Hardware is at end-of-life, hoping to move to Azure by piggy-backing with Health Dept.
		- Data owners were all very supportive, all keen for moving to Azure, province moved DMV to cloud earlier so are comfortable
		- Still do manual checks on data exports
	- REDCap
		- took 18 months to get Dal up and running
		- only supports faculty research, students need d a supervisor
		- needed VPR to sign for it
		- can run a dev version once you are licensed
		- Karl helps with HDNS, ask him with questions about technical stuff
- Meeting with Rosh, Ted and Ines #ACENET #NB-IRDT 
	- Add growth as another pillar on slide 1 - led by Rosh
	- new data providers will need assurance about access and control
