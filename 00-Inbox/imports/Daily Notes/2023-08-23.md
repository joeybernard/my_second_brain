### Notes
- Sorted out the Wiley LTI linking. I had messed up the organization tree inheritance in Brightspace. Once I fixed it, all of the external resource links showed up.
- Met with Marc Bragdon at the library. We had a good talk about Software Carpentry and the library. He was also very much on board with restarting the D2L committee.
- Contacted Brock Parks about the Wiley integration. Also reached out to try and arrange an in-person meet.
- Continued D2L training.
