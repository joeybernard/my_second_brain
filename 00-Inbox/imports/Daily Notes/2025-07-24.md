# Log
- created notes for Python Pub 1 #PythonPub
- meeting with the NextCloud folks #DRI/meeting #DRI/NextCloud
	- me, Lydia, Venkat Mahadevan, Matthew Smith, Jeff Ralbert
	- users will want to be able to manage their own groups
	- users will want to be able to encrypt data
	- we should be able to authenticate against institutions
	- actually, we will probably have to only authenticate to CCDB to manage usage
	- being federated and connecting internationally is a possible future option
	- will be hosted on Arbutus, using Kubernetes with Helm in the future; for now we will use the raw VM option
- Fixed my blog. It is now usable. I realized that jekyll is used for regular sites, too.
