# Day planner


# New Tasks


# Log
- 8:00am - Got emails sorted
- 9:15am - Had to restart the processing for P0113. I could not log in. Will stop at PScore to see the data frame structure
- 10:00am - Subaru oil/tire change. Reading, etc
- 12:15pm - P0113 - I think that we could speed up by doing the filtering before the pivoting. We just grab the columns of interest
- 1:30pm - Had a chat with Craig. For birdnet, we will setup a repo in gitlab. For encrypted containers, we can use Apptainer.
