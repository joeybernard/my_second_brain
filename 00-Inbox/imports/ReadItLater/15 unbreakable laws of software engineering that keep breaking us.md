## Introduction: the gravity of coding laws and how we still fall

Ask any senior engineer about the “laws” of software development, and you’ll get a smirk, a sigh, or a war story involving YAML and a 3 a.m. deploy. These aren’t just abstract ideas taught in dusty CS textbooks they’re the brutal truths that slap you mid-sprint when your estimate was “just a few hours.”

Why do we keep repeating the same mistakes? Because software engineering isn’t just writing code it’s juggling complexity, deadlines, people, and the absurdity of Jira tickets labeled “minor bug,” which then break production.

**Here is a Podcast video you can also watch to learn more.**

These laws exist because we’re not just coding for machines we’re coding **with** humans, **for** humans, and **against** entropy.
