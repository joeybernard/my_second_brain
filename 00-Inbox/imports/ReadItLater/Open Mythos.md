# [Open Mythos](https://cthulhueternal.com/open-mythos/)

In his fiction, H.P. Lovecraft began to build a complex intermeshed web of weird-sounding extra-dimensional, alien, and otherwise weird beings. He also invented obscure tomes of forbidden lore and nefarious cults of misguided worshippers. He also encouraged fellow horror writers to borrow his strange creations and add them into their own stories; in return, Lovecraft baked some of his friends’ alien names into his later stories.

In the century since this vast game of collective myth-building began, the so called “Cthulhu Mythos” — a name coined long after Lovecraft’s death in 1937 — has grown to become a patchwork of creations that is both expansive and problematic from an Intellectual Property perspective. While there are undeniably some parts of this Mythos that are firmly in the Public Domain, other parts have been added by more recent writers (some still alive) who retain IP rights to their creations.

When building a cool game scenario or campaign, the last thing anyone wants to be thinking about is whether the inclusion of this or that alien name might trigger a nasty email from lawyers representing a fiction author or the estate of a dead author. To make things easier for creators, the [German Lovecraft Society](https://www.deutschelovecraftgesellschaft.de/) invested an enormous amount of time and effort to isolate the “open” parts of the Mythos — effectively the elements invented by Lovecraft himself for stories that have now fallen into the Public Domain. They also built game statistics for those creations.

If you’re looking for familiar Lovecraftian horrors to add to your game or scenario … and you DON’T want to get bogged down in the legalities of which author/estate to contact about which odd-sounding god, creature, or tome … these are your go-to Mythos elements. We have taken the work by our esteemed German colleagues and partnered with them to translate them to English and tweak the statistics so they work with our *Cthulhu Eternal* and ***APOCTHULHU*** RPGs.

The Open Mythos is divided into **Rituals**, **Artifacts**, **Tomes**, **Cults**, and **Unnatural Entities.**

## Rituals

The descriptions of the following rituals are, for the most part, directly based on rituals described by Lovecraft himself. They should serve as inspiration and orientation for the Game Moderator to design his or her own rituals.

This format for ritual description is as follows:

**Study:** study duration; SAN loss.

**Activation:** duration; WP cost; SAN Loss.

**Description:** The summary of the effect, necessary actions and prerequisites of a ritual. Sometimes the successful performance of a ritual also requires certain skill values. Sometimes the effect causes an increase in unnatural knowledge.

## Artifacts

Tales of cosmic horror often feature Items with inexplicable powers, including the ability to open doorways or unlock unnatural knowledge. When such Artifacts fall into the hands of player characters, they provide evidence of things that should not exist, since their unique properties are utterly impossible to explain with known scientific principles.

This format for describing an Unnatural Artifact is as follows:

Rituals: which Unnatural Rituals (from those described elsewhere on the Open Mythos pages) may be cast by using the Artifact.

Activation Cost: WP cost to activate the Artifact.

SAN Loss: The mental damage created through the use of the artifact to tap the forces of the unnatural.

## Tomes

Books that contain knowledge about the Unnatural knowledge are mostly old, extremely rare, very dangerous, and always unique. Just tracking down or getting hold of such a book should never be a trivial exercise. Studying such a tome painstakingly is the only way to gain benefits from its secrets, but such study will always have consequences for the reader. In addition to a loss of SAN from reading, some books have other special effects that apply when studying them. In particular, some tomes can affect the scholar to such a degree that it causes changes to the character’s motivations (e.g., making them fixate on something they learned).

### Summary of Tomes

## Cults

Knowledge of the Unnatural promises vast power, wealth and privilege. Thus it is not surprising that all around the world, groups of humans – cults – toil secretly in the worship of the Great Old Ones, hungry to share in their terrible power and wisdom. But not all cults are made up purely of misguided people willingly supplicating themselves before invisible gods – some coalesce around non-human creatures present on the earth, and some are groups where individuals become a member unwillingly.

## Unnatural Entities

### Summary of Entities

The descriptions of the following unnatural entities (races of creatures and unique beings) are, for the most part, directly based on horrors described by Lovecraft himself.

Two different formats are used to describe these entities — one for ultra-powerful “god-like” powers like Great Cthulhu or others of the Great Old Ones, and another for less powerful races of alien beings.

Entries for God-like powers described a minimum set of game parameters, since most encounters with such potent beings should be resolved in a narrative way rather than dictated by the whimsy of dice. To support a GM in weaving a compelling description of such a mind-blasting experience, a number of details are helpful:

-   **POW statistic:** this is important to mental conflicts between Protagonists and the alien horrors; other game stats which relate to physical attributes are not provided since the outcomes of physical challenges should be dictated by the needs of the story.
-   **Common Types of Physical Attack:** these are the ways in which the “god-like” power is most likely to inflict harm upon those it encounters; they are not exhaustive and are provided to allow a GM to quickly invent scenes where terrible carnage is meted out on those who have dared use force against such a titan.
-   **Special Abilities:** Unique powers that will shape any physical or mental encounter with the entity.
-   **SAN Loss:** the corrosive effect of witnessing the “god-like” entity in the flesh, or simply receiving its alien visions.
-   **Quote:** a source quote from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft describing the entity or its influences.

The format for describing less powerful entities and races is more fully-featured in terms of game mechanics. It includes:

-   **Full Game Statistics:** STRength, CONstitution, DEXterity, INTelligence, and POWer are all listed on the same scale used for Protagonists (human normal ranges for each is 3-18).
-   **Derived Characteristics:** Hit Points (HP) and Willpower Points (WP).
-   **Size Category:** from smallest to largest — Extremely Small, Small, Medium, Large, Very Large, Extremely Large. Entities that are Extremely Small have an associated targeting penalty (making them harder to hit) while those that are Very Large or Extremely Large have a targeting bonus (making them easier to hit).
-   **Movement:** a description of the typical maximum distance the entity can traverse in a combat turn.
-   **Armor:** the number of Armor Points (if any) possessed by the entity.
-   **vs Lethal Damage:** describes how attacks that normally yield Lethal Damage against humans will affect this entity.
-   **Attack Modes:** for each mode, a % chance to hit is shown as well as the damage (either in terms of HPs or in terms of Lethality Rating). If an attack bypasses some points of target armor, this is also noted.
-   **Skills:** ratings for some of the entity’s skills, concentrating on those that may be important to a physical confrontation or efforts to evade.
-   **Special Abilities:** Unique powers (offensive, defensive, or other) that will shape encounters with the entity.
-   **SAN Loss:** the maddening effect of witnessing the entity in the flesh.
-   **Quote:** a source quote from the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft describing the entity or its influences.
