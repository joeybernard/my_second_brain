**Details**
<!-- Main content in body of my note  -->
At the University of Toronto, a Data Classification Table has been created that outlines the four levels of data. Level 1 data is public information, and level 4 is non-public sensitive information. The higher the level, the higher the risks.

#### Level 1

This category is for data that the University has designated as being generally accessible to the public. Examples include:

- Data from the U of T Directory
- Press releases
- News articles

#### Level 2

This is the default category. It includes data that the University has chosen not to make public but has also not been designated in another level. Examples include:

- U of T Advanced Directory for faculty and staff
- Most unpublished research
- Most course materials

#### Level 3

This category is for non-public data that contains personal information (as defined by Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act [FIPPA] for which appropriate permission to disclose has not been received) and other data that the University has designated as being level 3. Examples include:

- Student information and records
- Employee records
- Video surveillance security footage

#### Level 4

This category is for non-public data that is highly sensitive such that its disclosure poses substantially greater risk of harm to the University and to the data subject than level 3 data. Examples include:

- Personal health records as defined by Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
- Customer payment card information when the University is in a merchant capacity.
