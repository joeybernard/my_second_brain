*Zaō Gongen*, a key deity in *Shugendō*, in [Kinpusen-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinpusen-ji "Kinpusen-ji") Temple.

***Shugendō*** ([修験道](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BF%AE%E9%A8%93%E9%81%93 "wiktionary:修験道"), lit. the "Way \[of\] Trial \[and\] Practice", the "Way of *Shugen*, or *Gen*\-practice")[^asceticism-1] is a highly [syncretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism "Syncretism") religion,[^2] a body of [ascetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetic "Ascetic") practices that originated in the [Nara Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_period "Nara period") of [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") having evolved during the 7th century from an amalgamation of beliefs, philosophies, doctrines and ritual systems drawn from local [folk-religious practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_folklore "Japanese folklore"), [Shinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko-shinto "Ko-shinto") [mountain worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_worship "Mountain worship"), [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan "Buddhism in Japan") and [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism "Taoism"). The final purpose of *Shugendō* is for practitioners to find supernatural power and save themselves and the masses by conducting religious training while treading through steep mountain ranges. Practitioners are called *Shugenja* ([修験者](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BF%AE%E9%A8%93%E8%80%85 "wiktionary:修験者")) or *[Yamabushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamabushi "Yamabushi")* ([山伏](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E4%BC%8F "wiktionary:山伏"), literally "Mountain Prostrator").[^jimon2-3] The mountains where *shugendo* is practiced are all over Japan, and can span multiple mountains within one range such as the Ōmine mountain range with [Mount Hakkyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hakky%C5%8D "Mount Hakkyō") and [Mount Ōmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cmine "Mount Ōmine") or the Ishizuchisan mountain range with [Kamegamori](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%93%B6%E3%83%B6%E6%A3%AE "ja:瓶ヶ森") and Tengudake.

The *Shugendō* worldview includes a large pantheon of deities (which include Buddhist and Shinto figures). Some of the most important figures are the [tantric Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana "Vajrayana") figures of [Fudō Myōō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acala "Acala") and [Dainichi Nyorai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairocana "Vairocana").[^:0-4] Other key figures are *[Gongen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongen "Gongen")* ([権現](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A8%A9%E7%8F%BE "wiktionary:権現")), which are considered to be the manifestation of Buddhas as Japanese [kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami "Kami"). [Zaō Gongen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za%C5%8D_Gongen "Zaō Gongen") ([蔵王権現](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%94%B5%E7%8E%8B%E6%A8%A9%E7%8F%BE "wiktionary:蔵王権現")) is one of the most important gongen in *Shugendō*.[^jimon-5][^:1-6]

*Shugendō* evolved during the seventh century from an amalgamation of beliefs, philosophies, doctrines and ritual systems drawn from local folk-religious practices, Shinto mountain worship and Buddhism.[^jimon-5][^7] The seventh-century ascetic and mystic [En no Gyōja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_no_Gy%C5%8Dja "En no Gyōja") is widely considered as the patriarch of *Shugendō*, having first organized *Shugendō* as a doctrine. *Shugendō* literally means "the path of training and testing" or "the way to spiritual power through discipline."[^8][^9] *Shugendō* practitioners are also said to be descendants of the [Kōya Hijiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dya_Hijiri "Kōya Hijiri") monks of the eighth and ninth centuries.[^10]

From the ninth century, elements of [Vajrayana Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana "Vajrayana") such as [Shingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism "Shingon Buddhism") and [Tendai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendai "Tendai") Buddhism were taken into *Shugendō* and it developed further.[^jimon-5] In the Heian period, it became very popular among the nobles living in [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto "Kyoto") to visit [Kumano Sanzan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_shrine#Kumano_Sanzan "Kumano shrine") (three major shrines, [Kumano Hongū Taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Hong%C5%AB_Taisha "Kumano Hongū Taisha"), [Kumano Hayatama Taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Hayatama_Taisha "Kumano Hayatama Taisha") and [Kumano Nachi Taisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Nachi_Taisha "Kumano Nachi Taisha")), which was the common holy place of *Shugendō*, Shinto and Buddhism.[^syousetsu-11]

The [Meiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_period "Meiji period") government, which [erected a barrier between](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbutsu_bunri "Shinbutsu bunri") Shinto and [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Japan "Buddhism in Japan"), ruled that *Shugendō* was unacceptable because of its amalgamation of the two religions, and officially forbade it in 1872. With the advent of [religious freedom in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Japan "Freedom of religion in Japan") after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), *Shugendō* was revived.[^asceticism-1]

In 1907, Yoshitaro Shibasaki and his team successfully climbed [Mount Tsurugi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tsurugi_\(Toyama\) "Mount Tsurugi (Toyama)"), which was regarded as the last unclimbed mountain in Japan. However, they found a metal cane decoration and a sword on the top of the mountain, and it turned out that someone had reached the top before them. A later scientific investigation revealed that the metal cane decoration and sword dated from the late Nara period to the early Heian period and that *shugenja* had climbed Mount Tsurugi more than 1,000 years ago.[^12]

The Ōmine mountain range, which stretches 100 km from north to south and connects [Yoshino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshino_District,_Nara "Yoshino District, Nara") and [Kumano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Region "Kumano Region"), was historically the biggest practice place of *Shugendō*. The highest peak of the Ōmine mountain range is [Mount Hakkyō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hakky%C5%8D "Mount Hakkyō") at an altitude of 1915 m, and there are 75 places for ascetic practices along the mountain trail, and [Ōminesan-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cminesan-ji "Ōminesan-ji") Temple at the top of [Mount Ōmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_%C5%8Cmine "Mount Ōmine") at an altitude of 1719 m is considered to be the highest sacred site of *Shugendō*. At present, the Ōmine mountain range is designated as a [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") [World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site "World Heritage Site") "[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Sites_and_Pilgrimage_Routes_in_the_Kii_Mountain_Range "Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range")" and [Yoshino-Kumano National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshino-Kumano_National_Park "Yoshino-Kumano National Park").[^jimon-5][^:1-6]

In modern times, *Shugendō* is practiced mainly through [Tendai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendai "Tendai") and [Shingon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism "Shingon Buddhism") temples. Some temples include [Kimpusen-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimpusen-ji "Kimpusen-ji") in [Yoshino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshino_District,_Nara "Yoshino District, Nara") (Tendai), Ideha Shrine in the [Three Mountains of Dewa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mountains_of_Dewa "Three Mountains of Dewa") and [Daigo-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daigo-ji "Daigo-ji") in [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto "Kyoto") (Shingon).[^jimon-5]

According to Miyake Hitoshi, Shugend*ō* rituals include "festivals, fortunetelling, divination, prayers and incantations, exorcism, spells, charms and so forth."[^:0-4] Hitoshi describes the main worldview which informs Shugendo praxis as one which:

> assumes the existence of at least two realms of existence, that of the daily lives of human beings, and a separate, supernatural spiritual realm behind, and which controls that of the daily lives of human beings. The mountains are seen either as a sacred space which is part of both of these worlds, or is seen to actually be a part of the spiritual world. The altar space during the fire ceremony, or the area of a matsuri, is also considered to be this kind of sacred space.[^:0-4]

The [tantric Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana "Vajrayana") deity [Fudō Myōō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acala "Acala") (Sanskrit: Acala, "Immovable") plays a central role in the Shugendo cosmology practice.[^:0-4] Another important Buddha is [Dainichi Nyorai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairocana "Vairocana") (大日如来，Mahavairocana).[^:0-4] The Shugendo pantheon also includes numerous other Buddhist, Shinto and local religious figures.[^:0-4]

The most important Shugend*ō* practices are "practices in the mountains" (*nyūbu shugyō*, 入峰修行).[^:0-4] In Shugend*ō*, sacred mountains are seen as a supernatural home of numerous deities and as a symbol of the entire universe. According to Hitoshi, "the central element which forms both of these rituals is the symbolic action exhibited in a state of identification with the central deity Fudō Myōō."[^:0-4] The main source of the shugenja's spiritual power generally understood to be Fudō Myōō and a shugenja gains the ability to use Fudō Myōō's power through mountain practices.[^:0-4]

There are three main forms of mountain practice according to Miyake Hitoshi:[^:0-4]

- "Entering the mountain to make offerings of flowers, read or bury sutras, and so forth, in honor of various buddhas or other deities, based on the belief that the mountain is a sacred area like a mandala."
- "Entering the mountain for a certain period of time," a kind of mountain retreat during which yamabushi do various ascetic practices and receive esoteric knowledge and initiations.
- The most severe and advanced *nyūbu* is the wintertime retreat in the mountains. This is said to confer special spiritual powers.

Shugendō esoteric initiations are called *shōkanjō* (正灌頂) and are unique to Shugendō tradition (but are based on Vajrayana Buddhist [abhiseka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment_\(Vajrayana\) "Empowerment (Vajrayana)") ceremonies).[^:0-4]

Another important Shugendō practice is the demonstration of magical and spiritual powers (*genjutsu*, 験 術). Such displays may include fire walking, walking on swords, and entering boiling water.[^:0-4]

Yet another important religious practice in Shugendō is various rites or rituals of worship (*kuyōhō*, 供養法) which includes making offerings to Shugendō deities (such as Fudō Myōō and [Zaō Gongen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongen "Gongen")) as well as the chanting of sutras.[^:0-4]

Shugendō practitioners also take part in [Shinto festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_festivals "Japanese festivals") (matsuri, 祭) and make offerings to [kami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami "Kami").[^:0-4]

Other practices which are part of Shugendō include the following:[^:0-4]

- [Fortunetelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune-telling "Fortune-telling") and [divination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination "Divination") (*bokusen*)
- obtaining [oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle "Oracle") through [mediums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediumship "Mediumship") (*fujutsu*)
- obtaining oracles through mediums that have been possessed by a deity (*yori kitō*, 憑祈禱)
- Fire ceremonies for averting misfortunes (*sokusai [goma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homa_\(ritual\) "Homa (ritual)")*), usually focused around [Fudō Myōō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acala "Acala")
- Using [incantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation "Incantation") (*kaji*) for a specific purpose
- Spells and charms (*fuju, majinai*), used for healing, childbirth, protection and so on. These may be inscribed on [amulets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet "Amulet").
- [Exorcism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism "Exorcism") (*tsukimono otoshi*) for healing purposes

Shugendo ritualists also practice different rituals, prayers and ceremonies associated with particular deities (*shosonbō*, 諸尊法) including the buddhas [Yakushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaisajyaguru "Bhaisajyaguru") and [Amida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha "Amitābha"), the bodhisattvas [Monju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjushri "Manjushri"), [Kokuzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80k%C4%81%C5%9Bagarbha "Ākāśagarbha") and [Kannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin "Guanyin") as well as Indian deities like [Benzai-ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzaiten "Benzaiten") and Japanese Kami like [Inari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami "Inari Ōkami"), and [Daikoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikokuten "Daikokuten").[^:0-4]
