- I had talked to Paul Jordan (506-444-3611) at 11:39AM Feb. 23, 2023. He verified that if the motion put forward by Matthew Sheppard went forward and people used as if it was valid, we definitely would be open to law suits. I asked David and Marjorie to get a legal opinion. I heard nothing from them.
