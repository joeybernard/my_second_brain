Feb. 9, 2024 - Meeting with Aya and Peter

- UNBSJ did it once a year
- We may need to beef up the academic parts from UNBSJ
- There had been two courses, one theoretical and one practical
- Purposely left out the dossier as it was geared towards grad students
- Teaching dossiers should maybe be a separate module
- Maybe we should have UNBF DUT as module 1 and UNBSJ DUT as module 2
- Maybe have a teaching internship in their departments
- Look at the english department to see if they still offer the course on how to teach. Prof. Austin?
- Peter has offered to let Aya and I take some section of it.
- Peter has said that he is completely offered his materials
- He is willing to be a consultant as part of his last little top up contract
